## Quickstart

### Installing the client library

```bash
npm install google-auth-library
```

## Ways to authenticate
This library provides a variety of ways to authenticate to your Google services.
- [Application Default Credentials](#choosing-the-correct-credential-type-automatically) - Use Application Default Credentials when you use a single identity for all users in your application. Especially useful for applications running on Google Cloud. Application Default Credentials also support workload identity federation to access Google Cloud resources from non-Google Cloud platforms.
- [OAuth 2](#oauth2) - Use OAuth2 when you need to perform actions on behalf of the end user.
- [JSON Web Tokens](#json-web-tokens) - Use JWT when you are using a single identity for all users. Especially useful for server->server or server->API communication.
- [Google Compute](#compute) - Directly use a service account on Google Cloud Platform. Useful for server->server or server->API communication.
- [Workload Identity Federation](#workload-identity-federation) - Use workload identity federation to access Google Cloud resources from Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure or any identity provider that supports OpenID Connect (OIDC).
- [Workforce Identity Federation](#workforce-identity-federation) - Use workforce identity federation to access Google Cloud resources using an external identity provider (IdP) to authenticate and authorize a workforce—a group of users, such as employees, partners, and contractors—using IAM, so that the users can access Google Cloud services.
- [Impersonated Credentials Client](#impersonated-credentials-client) - access protected resources on behalf of another service account.
- [Downscoped Client](#downscoped-client) - Use Downscoped Client with Credential Access Boundary to generate a short-lived credential with downscoped, restricted IAM permissions that can use for Cloud Storage.

## Application Default Credentials
This library provides an implementation of [Application Default Credentials](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/getting-started)for Node.js. The [Application Default Credentials](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/getting-started) provide a simple way to get authorization credentials for use in calling Google APIs.

They are best suited for cases when the call needs to have the same identity and authorization level for the application independent of the user. This is the recommended approach to authorize calls to Cloud APIs, particularly when you're building an application that uses Google Cloud Platform.

Application Default Credentials also support workload identity federation to access Google Cloud resources from non-Google Cloud platforms including Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure or any identity provider that supports OpenID Connect (OIDC). Workload identity federation is recommended for non-Google Cloud environments as it avoids the need to download, manage and store service account private keys locally, see: [Workload Identity Federation](#workload-identity-federation).

#### Download your Service Account Credentials JSON file

To use Application Default Credentials, You first need to download a set of JSON credentials for your project. Go to **APIs & Auth** > **Credentials** in the [Google Developers Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) and select **Service account** from the **Add credentials** dropdown.

> This file is your *only copy* of these credentials. It should never be
> committed with your source code, and should be stored securely.

Once downloaded, store the path to this file in the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable.

#### Enable the API you want to use

Before making your API call, you must be sure the API you're calling has been enabled. Go to **APIs & Auth** > **APIs** in the [Google Developers Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) and enable the APIs you'd like to call. For the example below, you must enable the `DNS API`.


#### Choosing the correct credential type automatically

Rather than manually creating an OAuth2 client, JWT client, or Compute client, the auth library can create the correct credential type for you, depending upon the environment your code is running under.

For example, a JWT auth client will be created when your code is running on your local developer machine, and a Compute client will be created when the same code is running on Google Cloud Platform. If you need a specific set of scopes, you can pass those in the form of a string or an array to the `GoogleAuth` constructor.

The code below shows how to retrieve a default credential type, depending upon the runtime environment.

```js
const {GoogleAuth} = require('google-auth-library');

/**
* Instead of specifying the type of client you'd like to use (JWT, OAuth2, etc)
* this library will automatically choose the right client based on the environment.
*/
async function main() {
  const auth = new GoogleAuth({
    scopes: 'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform'
  });
  const client = await auth.getClient();
  const projectId = await auth.getProjectId();
  const url = `https://dns.googleapis.com/dns/v1/projects/${projectId}`;
  const res = await client.request({ url });
  console.log(res.data);
}

main().catch(console.error);
```

## OAuth2

This library comes with an [OAuth2](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OAuth2) client that allows you to retrieve an access token and refreshes the token and retry the request seamlessly if you also provide an `expiry_date` and the token is expired. The basics of Google's OAuth2 implementation is explained on [Google Authorization and Authentication documentation](https://developers.google.com/accounts/docs/OAuth2Login).

In the following examples, you may need a `CLIENT_ID`, `CLIENT_SECRET` and `REDIRECT_URL`. You can find these pieces of information by going to the [Developer Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/), clicking your project > APIs & auth > credentials.

For more information about OAuth2 and how it works, [see here](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OAuth2).

#### A complete OAuth2 example

Let's take a look at a complete example.

``` js
const {OAuth2Client} = require('google-auth-library');
const http = require('http');
const url = require('url');
const open = require('open');
const destroyer = require('server-destroy');

// Download your OAuth2 configuration from the Google
const keys = require('./oauth2.keys.json');

/**
* Start by acquiring a pre-authenticated oAuth2 client.
*/
async function main() {
  const oAuth2Client = await getAuthenticatedClient();
  // Make a simple request to the People API using our pre-authenticated client. The `request()` method
  // takes an GaxiosOptions object.  Visit https://github.com/JustinBeckwith/gaxios.
  const url = 'https://people.googleapis.com/v1/people/me?personFields=names';
  const res = await oAuth2Client.request({url});
  console.log(res.data);

  // After acquiring an access_token, you may want to check on the audience, expiration,
  // or original scopes requested.  You can do that with the `getTokenInfo` method.
  const tokenInfo = await oAuth2Client.getTokenInfo(
    oAuth2Client.credentials.access_token
  );
  console.log(tokenInfo);
}

/**
* Create a new OAuth2Client, and go through the OAuth2 content
* workflow.  Return the full client to the callback.
*/
function getAuthenticatedClient() {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    // create an oAuth client to authorize the API call.  Secrets are kept in a `keys.json` file,
    // which should be downloaded from the Google Developers Console.
    const oAuth2Client = new OAuth2Client(
      keys.web.client_id,
      keys.web.client_secret,
      keys.web.redirect_uris[0]
    );

    // Generate the url that will be used for the consent dialog.
    const authorizeUrl = oAuth2Client.generateAuthUrl({
      access_type: 'offline',
      scope: 'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.profile',
    });

    // Open an http server to accept the oauth callback. In this simple example, the
    // only request to our webserver is to /oauth2callback?code=<code>
    const server = http
      .createServer(async (req, res) => {
        try {
          if (req.url.indexOf('/oauth2callback') > -1) {
            // acquire the code from the querystring, and close the web server.
            const qs = new url.URL(req.url, 'http://localhost:3000')
              .searchParams;
            const code = qs.get('code');
            console.log(`Code is ${code}`);
            res.end('Authentication successful! Please return to the console.');
            server.destroy();

            // Now that we have the code, use that to acquire tokens.
            const r = await oAuth2Client.getToken(code);
            // Make sure to set the credentials on the OAuth2 client.
            oAuth2Client.setCredentials(r.tokens);
            console.info('Tokens acquired.');
            resolve(oAuth2Client);
          }
        } catch (e) {
          reject(e);
        }
      })
      .listen(3000, () => {
        // open the browser to the authorize url to start the workflow
        open(authorizeUrl, {wait: false}).then(cp => cp.unref());
      });
    destroyer(server);
  });
}

main().catch(console.error);
```

#### Handling token events

This library will automatically obtain an `access_token`, and automatically refresh the `access_token` if a `refresh_token` is present.  The `refresh_token` is only returned on the [first authorization](https://github.com/googleapis/google-api-nodejs-client/issues/750#issuecomment-304521450), so if you want to make sure you store it safely. An easy way to make sure you always store the most recent tokens is to use the `tokens` event:

```js
const client = await auth.getClient();

client.on('tokens', (tokens) => {
  if (tokens.refresh_token) {
    // store the refresh_token in my database!
    console.log(tokens.refresh_token);
  }
  console.log(tokens.access_token);
});

const url = `https://dns.googleapis.com/dns/v1/projects/${projectId}`;
const res = await client.request({ url });
// The `tokens` event would now be raised if this was the first request
```

#### Retrieve access token
With the code returned, you can ask for an access token as shown below:

``` js
const tokens = await oauth2Client.getToken(code);
// Now tokens contains an access_token and an optional refresh_token. Save them.
oauth2Client.setCredentials(tokens);
```

#### Obtaining a new Refresh Token
If you need to obtain a new `refresh_token`, ensure the call to `generateAuthUrl` sets the `access_type` to `offline`.  The refresh token will only be returned for the first authorization by the user.  To force consent, set the `prompt` property to `consent`:

```js
// Generate the url that will be used for the consent dialog.
const authorizeUrl = oAuth2Client.generateAuthUrl({
  // To get a refresh token, you MUST set access_type to `offline`.
  access_type: 'offline',
  // set the appropriate scopes
  scope: 'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.profile',
  // A refresh token is only returned the first time the user
  // consents to providing access.  For illustration purposes,
  // setting the prompt to 'consent' will force this consent
  // every time, forcing a refresh_token to be returned.
  prompt: 'consent'
});
```

#### Checking `access_token` information
After obtaining and storing an `access_token`, at a later time you may want to go check the expiration date,
original scopes, or audience for the token.  To get the token info, you can use the `getTokenInfo` method:

```js
// after acquiring an oAuth2Client...
const tokenInfo = await oAuth2Client.getTokenInfo('my-access-token');

// take a look at the scopes originally provisioned for the access token
console.log(tokenInfo.scopes);
```

This method will throw if the token is invalid.

#### OAuth2 with Installed Apps (Electron)
If you're authenticating with OAuth2 from an installed application (like Electron), you may not want to embed your `client_secret` inside of
